# Seq2Seq based chatbot

### Descriprion

This is a end-to-end implementation of chatbot based on deep RNN with LSTM cells. You can play with this chatbot and change following parameters:

	1. text preprocessing
		1. max sentence lenght
		2. preprocessing type
	2. vocabulary
		1. min and max sentence length
		2. vocabulary size
	3. neural network architecture
		1. simple RNN or Bidirectional RNN
		2. number of RNN layers
		3. pretrained embedding
		4. attention mechanism
	4. neural network parameters
		1. embedding size
		2. number of hidden units
		3. number of attention units
		4. dropout probability
		
You can set all parameters in yaml configuration file.
